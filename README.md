Crime Management System – SQL Project

->Project Overview

->The Crime Management System is a SQL-based database project designed to store, manage, and analyze crime records. 
This project includes:
- Creation of relational tables
- Insertion of sample data
- SQL queries based on real investigation operations
- Analysis of suspects, officers, crime types, and cases

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how crime data can be organized and retrieved efficiently.

->Database Structure

->The project contains the following tables:
1. Police_Station
2. Officer
3. Crime_Type
4. Crime_Case
5. Suspect

->Each table is linked through primary and foreign keys.
